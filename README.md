## Game Overview

This is a text adventure game inspired by "Kayla is famous".

Players will need to collect pieces of lost emotions and discover their lost memories as they play.  

Personally, I love the story of this game, but due to time constraints I wasn't able to get into it. I also used translation software to translate the text, which may have caused a lot of problems, so I apologise for that.
